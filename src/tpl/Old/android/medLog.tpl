MedLog records the taking of medicines.

By understanding the patterns of medicine taking,
MedLog can remind you when to take the next dose.

With medlog one never schedules a medicine to take.
Rather, one only records when it is taken.
the first time typing its name and dosage.

MedLog received many email letters of thanks
for its simlicity of use and capabilities.
