J.Crew's first shopping cart on the WEB is created using Software Engine.

Software Engines provided outsource services for the overall design and
architecture of the project, as well as the code development on the Unix side.

On the J.Crew side, three teams are involved:

The mainframe team develops the mainframe side of the communication protocol
which delivers inventory information to the system and places orders with the mainframe system.

A graphics department to design the html pages and provide the images designs.

A QA team for overall quality assurance of the web site.
